## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Honestly, I feel another week could be pumped into this beginer project, to work out all the smaller details. At some point I felt like redoing it and maybe after reviewing and learning more, I will. I feel in the current state it is quite messy and not scalable at all. But the purpose was to learn and looking forward to learn even more from checking out how other people aproached it.



### Continued development

Definitely much more focus is nedeed in CSS experience and keeping the code organised and scalable. Got to fill the big gaps in mobile friendly websites as well.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with general markup that I forgot or wasnt aware of.
- [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
